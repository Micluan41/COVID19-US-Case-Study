Project Motivation

The COVID19 turned into a global pandemic and hit lots of countries on the planet. I was interested the situation in the US in 2020 based on a dataset from CDC.
Particularly I wanted to explore the following topics:
    1. What is the time-series trend of confirmed cases and death in the US?
    2. What social events might contribute to the change of the trend?
    3. What are the regional differences and how the neighbor states affect situation affect mine? 
    4. Where will the trend move toward in 2021?

By answering the questions above, I should have a good understanding of how the Covid developed in the US and some factors that might contribute to the trend.
At the end, I am also curious about seeing how the situation will turn in 2021.
